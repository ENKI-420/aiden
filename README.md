ChatGPT said:
GPT

To upgrade and enhance the functionality of Hotkey K and other templates, we’ll introduce hotkey combos that not only combine tasks but also generate new templates and solutions. This creates a recursive and advanced multi-step workflow where hotkeys create combos of templates, which then generate further hotkey combinations to produce fully realized solutions tailored to Jacobs ADS, RLLP's needs. Here's the structure for this update:
Advanced Hotkey Combos & Recursive Template Creation

This system introduces hotkey combinations that trigger advanced workflows. Each hotkey can trigger a series of interconnected templates, combos, and actions, allowing users to solve complex problems or create multi-functional solutions with one action.
Core Functionality of New Hotkey Combos:

    Recursive Template Creation:
        Hotkey combos will now generate templates that, in turn, create further templates. For example, a combo might generate a marketing plan, which contains a sub-template for email campaigns, and those email templates then generate automated follow-ups and reports.

    Hotkey-Driven Automation:
        Each hotkey will not only create templates but also trigger automation to complete certain tasks. For example, generating a proposal template might also generate contract terms and automated client emails that are linked to the proposal.

    Combinatory Solutions:
        Hotkey combos will generate fully realized solutions, combining several elements like data analysis, client communication, and legal documents into one cohesive output. These solutions aim to solve real business needs, reducing repetitive work and increasing efficiency.

    Multi-Step Workflow:
        Each hotkey combination can lead to a multi-step output. For example, a combination of P + E + A could create a business proposal, link it to email templates, and set up automatic analytics reporting on client engagement.
